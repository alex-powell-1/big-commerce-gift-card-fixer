Big Commerce Gift Card Fixer

This is a simple python application for changing the recipient email address on a 
BigCommerce gift card. If a buyer enters the recipient's email address incorrectly,
there is no way to quickly correct this in the admin portal. This app is a nice solution.

To use:

1. Run the app
2. Enter the gift card code, press enter
3. Enter the desired email address, press enter
4. If the gift card exists, it will change the email and show you what it was changed from.

Requirements: 
1. Requests module
2. Your bigcommerce client id, access token, and store hash.
